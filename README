Welcome to stitch!

Stitch is a meta-build engine; it reads "targets" files that describe
build targets, resolves inter-target dependencies, and turns the high-level
target descriptions into a set of low-level actions to be performed via
a build driver such as Apache Ant, and a front-end script (usually called
'sbuild') that wraps around the driver and provides an interface to the
targets defined in your files.

Stitch is designed to gracefully handle the "loose coupling" required
of projects under active development; subprojects move around and filenames
change, but stitch targets provide a higher-level interface to the
build process that is more flexible than makefiles or Ant build files.

To deploy stitch, see the INSTALL file for instructions.
