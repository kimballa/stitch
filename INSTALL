To install stitch, run the following commands:

./bin/selfhosted-stitch
./sbuild -Drelease=true
cd build/redist/stitch-*
sudo python setup.py install
sudo ln -s /usr/share/stitch/bin/stitch /usr/bin/stitch

NOTE: The last step (the step that creates a symlink) might be different for you,
      depending on the system you're running on.  bin/stitch might exists in
      /usr/local/share/stitch, /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/share/stitch (on Macs),
      or somewhere entirely different.
